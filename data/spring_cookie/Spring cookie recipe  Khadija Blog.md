## Preparation

First, we mix the butter, brown sugar, salt and the sesame paste with a whisk.

Then add the fine ground walnut and flour, then we knead the dough until smooth.

Put the dough in a round shape and wrap it with cling film. Then chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.

Remove the dough ball from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface.

We form small balls and we start cutting them out (these are our cookies).

Preheat the oven to 180 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the cookies on the baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes at 180ºC.
