## Preparation

Peel the garlic and press through a garlic press (or chop very finely).

Wash, dry, pluck and finely chop the parsley and coriander.

Finely chop the salt lemon quarters.

Place the herbs, lemon zest and juice and olive oil in a tall mixing bowl and blend to a fine paste using a hand blender or mortar and pestle.

Put the herb paste in a bowl and mix well with the garlic, cumin, paprika powder, chili powder, salt and pepper. Add the oil and lemon juice and mix everything together well. Allow to marinate for approx. 30 mins.

Wash the eggplants and cut in half. Then make crosswise cuts in the flesh.

Coat the eggplants with the marinade. Spread on a baking tray and cook in the oven at 180 Â°C top/bottom heat for approx. 20 minutes.


To serve, sprinkle with freshly chopped coriander.

Goes well with fresh flatbread.

You can keep the sauce in a jar covered with oil, it can be kept in the fridge for 2 weeks.
