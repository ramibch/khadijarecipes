Strain the mixture, fill into a [0.5 L iSi cream dispenser](https://amzn.to/41ticFA), load with an [iSi cream capsule](https://amzn.to/3zXJHeI) and shake well.

Fill paper cups halfway with the batter.

Bake in the microwave at 800 watts for 40-50 seconds.

Allow the cup to cool with the opening facing down. Because in this way it retains its shape and structure.

To serve, cut the cookies into small pieces.
