## Preparation

Hokkaido pumpkins are best suited for this spread, as the flesh of other pumpkin varieties is too watery.

First step, preheat the oven to **200 degrees top/bottom heat (fan oven 180 degrees)**.

Cut the pumpkin in half, remove the seeds, scrape out the loose flesh with a spoon and cut into thin slices (do not remove the skin).

Mix the olive oil with the thyme leaves and place the prepared vegetables with the thyme and oil mixture on a baking tray lined with baking paper.

Bake the marinated pumpkin in the oven for 20 minutes until the flesh is soft.

Peel the shallots, cut into small cubes and fry in a pan with a few tablespoons of oil for about 3 minutes until translucent.

Once cooled, finely puree the pumpkin with a hand blender and mix with the cream cheese and onions. Season with salt and pepper if necessary.

For a spicier taste, you can optionally add some chili flakes.

You can form 6 small pumpkins from this mixture, roll them in nacho or pretzel potato chips and draw lines with the back of a knife so that it looks like a pumpkin.

If you have leftover bell pepper stalks or chives, you can place them on top of the pumpkin.

This delicious spread tastes great on fresh bread or baguette. Or simply as a dip with corn waffles or crackers.
