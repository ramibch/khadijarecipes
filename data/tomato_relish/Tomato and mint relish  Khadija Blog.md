## Preparation

Soak the fennel seeds in hot water for 10 minutes, drain.

Drain the tomatoes and cut into fine cubes

Simply place all the ingredients in the blender and mix well until a dough without pieces is formed. You may need to interrupt the blending process and press the dough down the sides.

Season to taste and store perfectly in sterilized jars.

Slice the zucchinis lengthways with a peeler or slicer, marinate with tomato relish and roll up.

Remarks:

I really like chili, so I always add a little more to the dip. If you don't like it so spicy, use less or add a pinch of sugar or another sweetener.
