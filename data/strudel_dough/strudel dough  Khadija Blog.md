## Preparation

Make the strudel dough yourself: First mix the flour with the salt, sugar, vinegar and oil in a bowl; gradually add the water and knead the dough vigorously.

Alternatively :Mix flour, egg, salt, vinegar, sugar and oil with a hand mixer or food processor. Add the water gradually until you get a smooth, supple dough.

Shape the dough into a ball, brush with oil and let rest in a hot rinsed bowl for 45 minutes.

Melt butter or margarine in a small saucepan and set aside.

Flatten the strudel dough on a lightly floured kitchen towel and roll out with a rolling pin.

Continue to lift the dough with both hands and roll it out paper-thin with the back of your hand until the kitchen towel is visible, and brush it with a little melted butter or margarine.

cut off thicker edges of dough,and top as desired.

The dough can be kept frozen for up to three months.
