## Preparation

Pour boiling water over the almonds, soak for 10 minutes to loosen the skin, drain and remove the skins.

Place the soaked almonds in a blender with the lemon juice, olive oil, peeled garlic cloves and salt. Blend everything well until a slightly sticky mixture is formed,

Pour the mixture into a cheesecloth, sprinkle with marjoram, tie well, place in a sieve and leave to drain over the dishes. The mixture should be left to drain overnight.

Brush the baking tray with olive oil, turn the pressed mixture out onto the baking tray, remove the baking sheet, brush with olive oil and bake the almond feta in the oven for approx. 25 - 30 minutes. The surface should be lightly browned and firm.

The vegan cheese can be kept in the fridge for approx. 5 days.
