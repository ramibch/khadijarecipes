## Preparation

dry dates should be soaked with hot water for 15 minutes. Until they are soaked with water and become soft.

If you use very soft dates, you can skip this step.

Either puree the dates briefly in a blender or chop them very finely.

Chop the walnut into small pieces.

Add all ingredients in a bowl and press together briefly with your hands, then use your hands to shape into equal-sized balls.

To do this, simply dip the finished balls into a bowl of shia seeds so that they are evenly coated with shia seeds.

If you like, you can also roll the balls in the various ingredients.

Store the finished balls in an airtight container and refrigerate, will keep for about a week in the refrigerator.

You can also freeze them. In the freezer they can be kept for about 3 months.

Let yourselves taste.
