#### Salt helps to enhance the chocolate flavor

Open a can of chickpeas and drain.

Add chickpea water, salt, 1 tablespoon sugar, and vanilla to a clean bowl and beat with hand mixer.

Whip aquafaba on high speed for at least 7 to 8 minutes until fluffy and stiff.

Depending on your taste, add more sugar or omit it altogether.

Allow melted chocolate to cool and gently mix into aquafaba.

Pour the mousse into a glass, and put in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 hours. And garnish with raspberries and a few mint leaves.

Let yourselves taste.
