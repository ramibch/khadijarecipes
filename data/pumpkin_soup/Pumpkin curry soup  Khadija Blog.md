## Preparation

Caramelize the sugar in a pan, deglaze with the Madeira and white port and simmer until the sugar has dissolved.

Wash, deseed and halve the pumpkin. Scoop out the pumpkin flesh with the seeds using a spoon, chop roughly and add.

Peel and dice the onions and add to the pan.

Pour vegetable stock or water over the soup.

Leave the soup to simmer for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally.

Once cooked, puree the soup with a hand blender, refine with cream or coconut milk and curry paste and thin down to the desired consistency.

Season the finished soup with salt, pepper, curry powder and nutmeg.

To serve:

Dry roast a small handful of pumpkin seeds in a pan over a medium heat until they start to crackle. Take them off the heat and sprinkle a small amount over the soup.

If you drizzle a little pumpkin seed oil on top, it not only looks great, but tastes really good too!
