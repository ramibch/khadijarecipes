## Preparation

Bring the water to a boil with the sugar until the sugar is dissolved, then add the citric acid and boil until the syrup has a clear color.

Allow to cool to room temperature.

Do not wash, otherwise the aromatic pollen will be washed away!

Gently shake out flower umbels to remove small insects and dip upside down in the syrup.

Cut the lemon into thin slices and add them to the pot as well.

Leave the syrup to infuse for 2 days in a cool place.


Then pour the syrup through a fine sieve or muslin cloth into a pot.

Boil briefly, fill elderflower syrup while still hot into clean, hot rinsed bottles and seal immediately.

The finished syrup is best stored in a cool and dark place, for example in the cellar, for a shelf life of up to one year.
