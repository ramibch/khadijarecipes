## Preparation

_Mix the ingredients for the hips well with a mixer or whisk until smooth. Make sure that no lumps of flour remain._

Heat the pan without oil.

Pour some batter into the pan and allow the coral chip to bake well.

Allow the liquid to boil until no more water splashes out.

After each frying, remove the colorful coral chips from the pan using a spatula, drain on kitchen paper and leave to cool.
